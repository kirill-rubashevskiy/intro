## Professional Goals

I am open for hire and internships in impactful projects.

## Interests

Besides studies, I enjoy hiking and cooking, both of which help me maintain a creative 
and fresh perspective in my professional work.

## Work in Progress

### Graildient Descent

A machine learning project that predicts sold prices for high-end, pre-owned, and 
limited edition fashion items on Grailed marketplace. Built with Python, the project 
demonstrates a complete ML system featuring:

🔄 **Data Pipeline**
- Selenium-based web scraper for Grailed listings
- Apache Airflow ETL pipeline for automated data collection 
- Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing workflow

🔍 **ML Development**
- Multimodal approach combining tabular and text features
- Extensive ML experiments with various models and architectures
- Best model: CatBoost achieving 37.1% improvement over baseline (RMSLE: 0.64)

🚀 **Production System**
- FastAPI service providing real-time price predictions
- Interactive Streamlit app for model exploration and predictions
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

⚙️ **Tech Stack**: Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, Apache Airflow, Weights & Biases, scikit-learn, CatBoost

## Completed Projects

### [Authorship Identification ML Service](https://github.com/kirill-rubashevskiy/mlds23-authorship-identification)

#### Project Overview

This machine learning service was designed to identify the authorship of texts among ten 
prominent Russian 19th-century writers. Developed as part of my master’s degree 
coursework, the project focused on natural language processing and building a full ML 
pipeline from data collection to deployment.

#### Main Goals

- **Build an End-to-End ML Pipeline**: From data collection from open sources to 
monitoring the performance of a deployed service.
- **Apply ML Techniques in NLP**: Employ machine learning algorithms tailored for 
natural language processing (NLP).
- **Get Hands-On MLOps and DevOps Experience**: Practical experience in MLOps and DevOps 
principles, including cloud storage, microservice architecture, containerization, 
deployment, and performance monitoring.

#### Project Outcomes

- **Best Model Performance**: Developed a logistic regression model using text 
statistics and Bag-of-Words embeddings, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.85 on test 
data.
- **Service Deployment**: Successfully built and deployed a FastAPI application to 
handle predictions and integrated a Telegram bot for user interaction.

> **Note**: This project is primarily in Russian.
