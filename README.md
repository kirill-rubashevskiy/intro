## Professional Goals

I am open for hire and internships in impactful projects.

## Interests

Besides studies, I enjoy hiking and cooking, both of which help me maintain a creative and fresh perspective in my professional work.

## Work in Progress

### [Graildient Descent](https://github.com/kirill-rubashevskiy/graildient-descent)

#### Project Overview

**Graildient Descent** is an ongoing machine learning project focused on predicting the sold prices of high-end fashion items listed on [Grailed](https://www.grailed.com/), an online marketplace. The project involves building a comprehensive data pipeline that includes web scraping, ETL, and model training to forecast item sold prices.

This project works with **multimodal data**:
- **Tabular features**: Item attributes like brand, category, and size.
- **Text features**: Descriptions and titles of items.
- **Images**: Collected cover images of items.

#### Main Goals

- **Data Collection**: Scrape data from Grailed listings, including images, item details, and sold prices.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Build an Apache Airflow-based ETL pipeline to manage and process the collected data.
- **Price Prediction**: Develop machine learning models to predict sold prices using features like item descriptions, categories, and more.
- **Deployment**: Showcase the results through a Streamlit app for EDA and predictions, and a FastAPI service for real-time price predictions.

#### Current Status

- **Scraper**: Successfully implemented a scraper to collect data from Grailed, including item images and sold prices.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Built a fully functional ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Currently working on EDA, focusing on text and categorical features, with insights into fashion categories and pricing trends.

Stay tuned for more updates as I run machine learning experiments and refine the model!

## Completed Projects

### [Authorship Identification ML Service](https://github.com/kirill-rubashevskiy/mlds23-authorship-identification)

#### Project Overview

This machine learning service was designed to identify the authorship of texts among ten prominent Russian 19th-century writers. Developed as part of my masterâ€™s degree coursework, the project focused on natural language processing and building a full ML pipeline from data collection to deployment.

#### Main Goals

- **Build an End-to-End ML Pipeline**: From data collection from open sources to monitoring the performance of a deployed service.
- **Apply ML Techniques in NLP**: Employ machine learning algorithms tailored for natural language processing (NLP).
- **Get Hands-On MLOps and DevOps Experience**: Practical experience in MLOps and DevOps principles, including cloud storage, microservice architecture, containerization, deployment, and performance monitoring.

#### Project Outcomes

- **Best Model Performance**: Developed a logistic regression model using text statistics and Bag-of-Words embeddings, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.85 on test data.
- **Service Deployment**: Successfully built and deployed a FastAPI application to handle predictions and integrated a Telegram bot for user interaction.

> **Note**: This project is primarily in Russian.
